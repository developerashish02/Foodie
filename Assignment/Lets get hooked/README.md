Here are the corrected answers with improved grammar and spelling:

1. **Difference between Named Export, Default Export, and `*` as Export:**

   - **Named Export:** Used when a file has multiple exports. Each export is given a name, and those names are used to import the specific exports in other files.
   - **Default Export:** Used when a file has only one export. This export is considered the default export and can be imported without using curly braces.
   - **`*` as Export:** Also known as namespace import. It allows importing all exports from a module into a single namespace object.

2. **Importance of config.js File:**

   - The `config.js` file is important for storing hard-coded data or URLs. It's a best practice to keep such configurations in a separate file or utility file for easier management and modification.

3. **React Hooks:**

   - React Hooks are JavaScript functions provided by React to enable the use of state and other React features in functional components. They allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class.

4. **Need for useState Hook:**
   - The `useState` Hook is used to maintain the state of a component in a functional component. It allows functional components to have state, which was previously only possible in class components.
